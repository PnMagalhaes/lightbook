Lightbook is a project witch aims to allow kids in Africa to have light to study after the sun goes down.

# Why we are doing it?
We have been in Marocco a couple of times and notice that, in some remote villages, there is no light after the sun goes down. It means that lots of children don't have the conditions to study at their houses. Another problem is the fact that the number of run over children caused by the lack of light is astounding.

# How we are doing it? 
We came up with the idea to build a small flashlight that students could charge at school and bring that with them to their houses. It helps to stay visible at the way back from school and to get some extra light hours to study.
